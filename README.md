# Mental-Health-Chatbot-using-BERT
AI-powered chatbots are increasingly being developed to provide emotional support for individuals dealing with anxiety and depression. A key element in building such chatbots is a well-structured dataset that trains models to understand and respond empathetically.

This dataset contains diverse mental health conversations, including casual chats, FAQs, therapy discussions, and advice for those struggling with anxiety and depression. It organizes user inputs into "intents," each representing a purpose (e.g., sad for sadness). Each intent includes example messages (patterns) and suitable responses, allowing the model to recognize intent and generate compassionate replies.

By leveraging this dataset, developers can train AI chatbots to offer emotional guidance and mental health support.

The dataset used in this model is called Mental Health Conversational Data from kaggle
